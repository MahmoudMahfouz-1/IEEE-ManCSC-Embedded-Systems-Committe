Task2:
	After research I found out that to answer this question, First we must define what is an interrupt ?
	- An interrupt is a signal sent to the microprocessor requesting its services do the control is transferred to the sub-routine and after executing the interrupt the control goes back to the main program, and the interrupts are classified into Vectored and Non-Vectored Interrupts and hardware / software interrupts.
	
	Vectored Interrupts: are those and the program control is transferred to that address after executing the interrupts
	Non-Vectored Interrupts: are those which don't have a predefined address so the CPU won't know which device caused the interrupt.
	I didn't find an exact answer for the last part of the question but i think that they both might be used.
Task3:
	Communication Protocol: It is the way we exchange data between computing systems, For example if we want to exchange data between two microcontrollers we will use a communication protocol.

Bouns Task:
	Callback Function: is a function that is passed to another function as an argument using a pointer to this function.
	So if you want to use a function in the main function without calling it directly you will make a function that takes a pointer to a function, inside this function you will derefference the pointer to function that you took as an argument, In the main funtion you will make a pointer to a function and give it the address of the first function and then call the second funtion and give it the pointer, and it will call the the first function that you don't want to call it directly in the main funtion.

	example:
		void func1()
		{
			printf("Hello");
		} 
		void func2(void(*ptr)())
		{
			(*ptr) ();
		}
		int main()
		{
			void (*pt) () = &func1;
			func2(pt);


			return 0;
		}
